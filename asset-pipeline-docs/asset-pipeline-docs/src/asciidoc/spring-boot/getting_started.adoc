=== Getting Started

In Spring Boot assets live in the same place as a standard gradle implementation `src/assets` directory. This folder should contain organizational subdirectories `javascripts`, `images`, and `stylesheets`.

To get started simply add asset-pipeline to your `build.gradle` file (See Gradle usage). And the ratpacks plugin to the dependencies block:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
dependencies {
  runtime 'com.bertramlabs.plugins:asset-pipeline-spring-boot:{project-version}'
  //Example LESS or Sass Integration
  //assets 'com.bertramlabs.plugins:less-asset-pipeline:{project-version}'
  //assets 'com.bertramlabs.plugins:sass-asset-pipeline:{project-version}'
}
----

NOTE: Asset-Pipeline requires at least groovy 2.0.7 to be used within a spring boot application.

It is also necessary to add `ComponentScan` to your application class in order for the asset-pipeline plugin to properly initialize.

[source,groovy]
----
package demo

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(['demo','asset.pipeline.springboot'])
@EnableAutoConfiguration
class Application {

    static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run Application, args
    }
}
----

By default a servlet filter will be registered to the url `/assets` from which all assets will be served.

==== Development Runtime

A great feature built into asset-pipeline is its development runtime support. All assets that are used in your application are automatically generated and processed on the fly when requested. This means when a change is made in a css file or javascript file, the results are instant. A refresh of the page will reflect the changes without needing to wait for any type of `FileWatcher`. These results are also cached making it highly performant as your project grows.
